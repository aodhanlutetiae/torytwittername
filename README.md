The tweets sent by the Conservative Party press office while rebranded as a 'factchecker' during an ITV debate between Conservative and Labour leaders (19/11/2019). 49 of them were original and the remaining (165) were retweets.

There is a file with all the tweets and one without the retweets. The retweets were truncated during the API call.
